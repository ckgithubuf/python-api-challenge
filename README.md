# python-api-challenge

This repo holds code to analyse data of multiple cities across the world. Coordinates of those cities were randomly generated.
1. Using OpenWeatherAPI we fetched weather information for all the cities & analysed how temperature is increasing as latitude is decreasing in nothern hemispehere, increasing in southern hemishpere. This helps us understand that temperature is highest at equator
3. Using GeoApifyAPI we fetched hotel information for all the cities.
